## My Journey in Game Development
#### Where I Start my Journey
I start my journey on the late 2018 by take the academy from Raion Community about Game Programming in 2D Game Development.
From the Raion's academy I've been learn about how to code UI in Game and simple mechanic to generate random position
of an object.

#### My First Global Game Jam
My first Global Game Jam is Global Game Jam 2021 Jatim. This is my first time participating in Global Game Jam 
because my parents didn't allow me to go out of town and stay for a few days and since global game jam 2021 is held online, so I can attend from home.

#### Tools that I use
I've been use Unity Engine 2 years from my first academy at Raion Community. Unity Engine is friendly to use, easy to learn because have a big community.
I also tried to make game in Discord Bot name Flappy Bot using Python. This game is RPG Text Game. I'm just trying to make a game on discord bot for about 1 month
